{"question": "What is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)?",

"answer" : "A Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 or Companies Act, 2013, and engaged in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/securities issued by Government or local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, etc., as their principal business, but does not include any institution whose principal business is that of agriculture activity, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods (other than securities) or providing any services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable property. A non-banking institution which is a company and has principal business of receiving deposits under any scheme or arrangement in one lump sum or in installments by way of contributions or in any other manner, is also a non-banking financial company (Residuary non-banking company)."
},
{
  "question": "What does conducting financial activity as “principal business” mean?",
  "answer": "Financial activity as principal business is when a company’s financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the total assets (netted off by intangible assets) and income from financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the gross income. A company which fulfils both these criteria needs to get registered as NBFC with the Reserve Bank. The term 'principal business' has not been defined in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Hence, the Reserve Bank has defined it vide Press Release 1998-99/1269 dated April 08, 1999 so as to ensure that only companies predominantly engaged in financial activity get registered with it and are regulated and supervised by it. Hence, if there are companies engaged in agricultural operations, industrial activity, purchase and sale of goods, providing services or purchase, sale or construction of immovable property as their principal business and are doing some financial business in a small way, they will not be regulated by the Reserve Bank. Interestingly, this test is popularly known as 50-50 test and is applied to determine whether or not a company is into financial business."
},
{
  "question": "NBFCs are doing functions similar to banks. What is the difference between banks and NBFCs?",

However, in terms of the powers conferred upon the Reserve Bank, to obviate dual regulation, certain categories of NBFCs which are regulated by other regulators are exempted from the requirement of registration with the Reserve Bank viz., Alternative Investment Fund/ Merchant Banking companies/ Stock broking companies registered with SEBI; Insurance Company holding a valid Certificate of Registration issued by IRDA; Nidhi companies as notified under Section 620A of the Companies Act, 1956; Chit companies doing the business of chits as defined in clause (b) of Section 2 of the Chit Funds Act, 1982; Stock Exchange or a Mutual Benefit company, etc."

{
  "question": "What is Scale Based Regulatory Framework or SBR Framework for NBFCs?",
  "answer": "Over the years, the NBFC sector had evolved considerably in terms of size, complexity, and interconnectedness within the financial sector and hence there was a need to align the regulatory framework for NBFCs keeping in view their changing risk profile. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has implemented a Scale-Based Regulatory Framework or SBR Framework for regulation of NBFCs w.e.f. October 01, 2022. The SBR Framework which is based on the principle of proportionality takes into account various factors like size, activity, complexity, interconnectedness, etc., within the financial sector for categorising NBFCs into various layers. The degree of regulations increases as one moves from lower to higher layers. SBR Framework classifies NBFCs into four layers. NBFCs in the lowest layer shall be known as NBFC – Base Layer (NBFC-BL). NBFCs in middle layer and upper layer shall be known as NBFC – Middle Layer (NBFC-ML) and NBFC – Upper Layer (NBFC-UL) respectively and are considered to be systemically significant. The Top Layer is ideally expected to be empty and will be known as NBFC - Top Layer (NBFC-TL) which will be populated only if the Reserve Bank is of the opinion that there is a substantial increase in the potential systemic risk from specific NBFCs in the Upper Layer."
},
{
  "question": "Does the Reserve Bank regulate all financial companies?",
  "answer": "No, the Reserve Bank does not regulate all financial companies. Depending upon the nature of activities, the financial companies may fall under the regulatory purview of other Regulators like SEBI, IRDAI, Government, etc. To name a few, the Merchant Banking Companies/Alternative Investment Fund Company/stock-exchanges/stock brokers/sub-brokers are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India, and Insurance companies are regulated by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. Similarly, Chit Fund Companies are regulated by the respective State Governments and Nidhi Companies are regulated by Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. Companies that do financial business but are regulated by other regulators are given specific exemption by the Reserve Bank from its regulatory requirements for avoiding duality of regulation. The categories of NBFCs which are exempted from certain provisions of the RBI Act, 1934 are specified in the ‘Master Direction - Exemptions from the provisions of RBI Act, 1934 dated August 25, 2016."

  "answer": "The term ‘deposit’ is defined under Section 45 I(bb) of the RBI Act, 1934. ‘Deposit’ includes and shall be deemed always to have included any receipt of money by way of deposit or loan or in any other form but does not include: (i) amount raised by way of share capital, or contributed as capital by partners of a firm; (ii) amount received from a scheduled bank, a co-operative bank, a banking company, Development bank, State Financial Corporation, IDBI or any other institution specified by RBI; (iii) amount received in ordinary course of business by way of security deposit, dealership deposit, earnest money, advance against orders for goods, properties or services; (iv) amount received by a registered money lender other than a body corporate; (v) amount received by way of subscriptions in respect of a ‘Chit’. Para 3(xiii) of the Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 defines a ‘public deposit’ as a ‘deposit’ as defined under Section 45I(bb) of the RBI Act, 1934 and further excludes several categories such as amounts received from government, financial institutions, other companies, directors/shareholders (with conditions), debentures, infrastructure bonds, etc. Thus, the directions exclude from the definition of public deposit, amounts raised from certain set of informed lenders who can make independent decision."

{
  "question": "Which entities can legally accept deposits from public?",
  "answer": "Banks, including co-operative banks, can accept deposits. NBFCs (including Housing Finance Companies) which have been issued Certificate of Registration by the Reserve Bank with a specific licence to accept deposits, are entitled to accept public deposits. Only those NBFCs holding a deposit accepting Certificate of Registration can accept deposits, and only to the permissible extent. Companies authorized by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules can also accept deposits up to a certain limit. Cooperative Credit Societies can accept deposits from their members but not from the general public. It is not legally permissible for other entities to accept public deposits. Unincorporated bodies like individuals, partnership firms, and associations of individuals are prohibited from accepting deposits. Further, the First Schedule of the ‘Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act, 2019’ lists regulated deposit schemes."
},
{
  "question": "Can all NBFCs accept deposits? Is there any ceiling on acceptance of Public Deposits? What is the rate of interest and period of deposit which NBFCs can accept?",
  "answer": "All NBFCs are not entitled to accept public deposits. Only those NBFCs that hold a deposit accepting Certificate of Registration, and have a minimum investment grade credit rating of ‘BBB–‘ from any of the SEBI-registered credit rating agencies, are allowed to accept/ hold public deposits up to a limit of 1.5 times of their Net Owned Funds. Presently, the maximum rate of interest an NBFC can offer is 12.5%. The interest may be paid or compounded at rests not shorter than monthly rests. The NBFCs are allowed to accept/ renew public deposits which are repayable after 12 months but not later than 60 months. They cannot accept deposits repayable on demand. However, as a matter of public policy, Reserve Bank has decided that only banks should be allowed to accept public deposits and as such, has, since 1997, not issued any Certificate of Registration (CoR) to new NBFCs for acceptance of public deposits."
},

{
  "question": "In respect of companies which do not fulfill the 50-50 criteria but are accepting deposits – do they come under Reserve Bank’s purview?",
  "answer": "A company which does not have financial assets which are more than 50% of its total assets and does not derive at least 50% of its gross income from such assets is not an NBFC. Its principal business would be non-financial activity like agricultural operations, industrial activity, purchase or sale of goods or purchase/construction of immovable property, and will be a non-banking non-financial company. Acceptance of deposits by a Non-Banking Non-Financial Company are governed by the rules and regulations issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs."
},

{
  "question": "Why is the Reserve Bank so restrictive in allowing NBFCs to raise public deposits?",
  "answer": "The Reserve Bank's overarching concern while regulating/ supervising any financial entity is protection of depositors' interest. Depositors place deposit with any entity on trust unlike an investor who invests in the shares of a company with the intention of sharing the risk as well as return with the promoters. Protection of depositors' interest, thus, is supreme in financial regulation. Further, the deposits of NBFCs do not have insurance from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation."
},

{
  "question": "Which are the NBFCs specifically authorized by the Reserve Bank to accept deposits?",
  "answer": "The Reserve Bank publishes the list of NBFCs that hold a valid Certificate of Registration for accepting deposits on its website (www.rbi.org.in) under Regulation → Non-Banking → NBFCs. Members of the public are advised to check the list before placing deposits with NBFCs."
},

{

},

{
  "question": "How does the Reserve Bank come to know about unauthorized acceptance of deposits by companies not registered with it or of NBFCs engaged in lending or investment activities without obtaining the Certificate of Registration from it?",
  "answer": "NBFCs that ought to have sought registration from the Reserve Bank but are functioning without doing so are committing a breach of law. Such companies are liable for action as envisaged under the RBI Act, 1934. To identify such entities, the Reserve Bank has multiple sources of information. These include market intelligence, complaints received from affected parties, industry sources, and exception reports submitted by statutory auditors in terms of Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Companies Auditor’s Report (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 (as amended from time to time). Further, the State Level Co-ordination Committees (SLCC) is convened by the Reserve Bank in all the States/UTs on quarterly basis. The SLCC is chaired by the Chief Secretary/ Administrator of the concerned State/UT and has, as its members, apart from the Reserve Bank, the Regional Directorate of the MCA/ ROC, local unit of SEBI, NHB, Registrar of Chits, ICAI, Economic Intelligence Unit of the State Police and officials from Law and Home Ministries of the State Government.

{
  "question": "There are many jewellery shops taking money from the public in instalments. Is this amounting to acceptance of deposits?",
  "answer": "It depends on whether the money is received as advance for delivering jewellery at a future date or whether the money is received with a promise to return the same with interest. The money accepted by Jewellery shops in instalments for the purpose of delivering jewellery at the end of the period of contract is not deposit. It will amount to acceptance of deposits if in return for the money received, the jewellery shop promises to return the principal amount along with interest."
},

{
  "question": "What if NBFCs which have not been authorized to accept public deposits use proprietorship/partnership firms floated by their promoters to collect deposits?",
  "answer": "NBFCs are prohibited by the Reserve Bank from associating with any unincorporated bodies. If NBFCs associate themselves with unincorporated entities which are accepting deposits in contravention of RBI Act, they are also liable for penal action under the Act, or action under the Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, or the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act, 2019, as applicable."
},

{
  "question": "What is the difference between acceptance of money by Chit Funds and acceptance of deposits?",
  "answer": "Deposits are defined under the RBI Act 1934 as acceptance of money other than that raised by way of share capital, money received from banks and other financial institutions, money received as security deposit, earnest money and advance against goods or services and subscriptions to chits. All other amounts received in any form are treated as deposits. Chit Funds activity involves contributions by members in instalments by way of subscription to the Chit and by rotation each member of the Chit receives the chit amount. The subscriptions are specifically excluded from the definition of deposits and cannot be termed as deposits. While Chit funds may collect subscriptions as above, they are prohibited by the Reserve Bank from accepting deposits from public (except from shareholders) with effect from August 2009."

    "question": "In case an NBFC defaults in repayment of deposit, what course of action can be taken by depositors?",

{
  "question": "Can an NBFC pre-pay its public deposits?",
  "answer": "An NBFC accepts deposits under a mutual contract with its depositors. In case a depositor requests for pre-mature payment, the Reserve Bank has prescribed regulations for such an eventuality in the Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 (as amended from time to time) wherein it is specified that NBFCs cannot grant any loan against a public deposit or make premature repayment of a public deposit within a period of three months (lock-in period) from the date of its acceptance. However, in the event of death of a depositor, the NBFC may, even within the lock-in period, repay the deposit at the request of the joint holders with survivor clause, or to the nominee / legal heir only against submission of relevant proof, to the satisfaction of the NBFC. Further, in order to enable a depositor to meet the expenses of an emergent nature, the NBFC may subject to satisfaction of the NBFC about the circumstances, prematurely repay tiny deposits (i.e., up to ₹10,000/-) and also other deposits, as per the provisions laid down by the Reserve Bank.\n\nAn NBFC, which is not a problem company, subject to above provisions, may permit premature repayment of a public deposit after the lock–in period, at its sole discretion, at the rate of interest prescribed by the Reserve Bank.\n\nA problem NBFC is prohibited from making premature repayment of any deposits or granting any loan against public deposits, as the case may be. The prohibition shall not, however, apply in the case of death of depositor or repayment of tiny deposits (i.e. up to ₹10,000/-) in order to enable a depositor to meet expenses of an emergent nature, subject to lock in period of 3 months in the latter case."

{
  "question": " What is the liquid assets requirement for the deposit taking companies? Where are these assets kept? Do depositors have any claims on them?",

If the credit rating is downgraded below this level, the NBFC must stop accepting public deposits and stop renewing existing deposits immediately. However, existing deposits are allowed to run off to maturity. The NBFC must also report the position to the Reserve Bank within fifteen working days."
},
{
"question": "What is the purpose of enacting Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act by the State Governments?",

The State Governments, through this Act, are empowered to attach and sell assets of defaulting companies, entities, or officials to protect depositors."
},
{
"question": " Will the passage of the Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments by the State Governments help in nailing unincorporated entities and companies from unauthorizedly accepting deposits?",
"answer": "Yes. The Act makes unauthorized acceptance of deposits a cognizable offence, allowing imprisonment and prosecution. State Governments can attach properties of such entities and distribute proceeds to depositors. The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act, 2019, further strengthens mechanisms to prevent unregulated deposit schemes, including attachment and sale of property, designated courts, powers for investigation, search & seizure, and penal provisions."
},
{
"question": "Still there are cases of unscrupulous financial entities cheating public time and again. How does the Reserve Bank plan to strengthen its surveillance on unauthorized acceptance of deposits/unauthorized conduct of NBFI business by companies?",

},
{
"question": " If Chit Fund companies are financial entities, why are they not regulated by the Reserve Bank?",

},
{
"question": "What are money circulation/Ponzi/multi-level marketing schemes?",
"answer": "These schemes promise easy or quick money upon enrolling members. Multi-level marketing or pyramid schemes derive income mostly from enrolling new members and collecting subscription fees, rather than from selling products.

},
{
"question": "What are Unincorporated Bodies (UIBs)? Does the Reserve Bank have any role to play in curbing illegal deposit acceptance activities of UIBs? Who has the power to take action against UIBs accepting deposits?",
"answer": "UIBs include individuals, firms, or unincorporated associations. They are prohibited from accepting deposits under Section 45S of the RBI Act, 1934. Violations can lead to imprisonment or fines. State Governments take action against UIBs, while RBI forwards complaints to State EOW.
